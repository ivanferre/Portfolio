README

This is the description file of the Portfolio project.

The portfolio project is a very simple set of files that I use to check some git, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap features.  The origin of the project is a PowerCoders task request.

The task is based on this tutorial:

The demonstration website is hosted here:
