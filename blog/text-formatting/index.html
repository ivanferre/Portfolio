            <p>February 26, 2023</p>
            <hr>

            <p>In the <a href="../../links/index.html" target="_blank" title="Links">links page</a>, I had very long listings. I thought I could optimize screen usage by splitting the text into two separate columns.</p>

            <p>I will first explain what I did not: to create a table. This would have been an obvious choice, should I had more information to display about each reference. Or a simple way to do it when there would only be a grid of words. But what I wanted to do was to split the lists into separate columns, not only to present them more clearly, but also to have them classified by some criteria.</p>

            <p>And I wanted to keep learning new features, too.</p>

            <p>So I have chosen to display the text in more than one column. This also lets me write <em>lists</em> instead of <em>items</em> separately. Bootstrap's CSS have plenty of classes defined to make this easy. The main trick is to have a container to wrap the rows and columns, and to have a clear idea on how to organize things. It's a very flexible and powerful tool that offers much more than I needed for this simple purpose.</p>

            <p>The Bootstrap Grid System is very well explained in <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/#auto-layout-columns" title="Grid System" target="_blank">this page</a>. It's based on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox" title="Basic Concepts of Flexbox" target="_blank">flexbox</a> and is fully responsive. Together with the last link to Mozilla documentation, it also refers to this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background" title="A Complete Guide to Flexbox" target="_blank">CSS Tricks flexbox Guide</a> that will explain everything you may want to know about flexbox.</p>

            <p>The results as of today are not perfect due to a minor issue that I'm not in the mood of correcting right now. The default values in Bootstrap's CSS define a padding for each column. If the left padding is not stripped off, you will notice a very slight difference on the <em>left margin</em> of the page for the text that are single-column, and the ones multi-column. Right now, I prefer to move on to other text formatting topics.</p>

            <p>Next entry in this blog coming soon. Stay tuned!</p>
